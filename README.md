# Image describe pipe
In this project, we are implementing a lightweight web service app in which the modules first detect and extract the faces available in the image. Then it will evaluate the input image and compare it with provided images by each user that are stored in the database. The output includes the name, coordinations, sentiment of each extracted face, and a brief description of the scene.
